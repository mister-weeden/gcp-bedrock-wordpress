# Integrating Canvas LMS with WordPress: A Developer's Journey

As educational technology continues to evolve, integrating different platforms has become essential for creating seamless learning experiences. In this post, I'll share my experience integrating Canvas LMS with WordPress, providing a step-by-step guide that might help others looking to accomplish the same.

## My Integration Journey

### 1. Examining the Canvas LMS Source Code

The first step in my integration journey was to thoroughly examine the Canvas LMS source code. This was crucial for understanding how Canvas structures its data and what APIs are available for integration purposes. By diving into the source code, I gained valuable insights into:

- The data models Canvas uses for courses, assignments, and user information
- Authentication mechanisms and security protocols
- Available API endpoints and their documentation
- How Canvas handles external tool integrations

This deep dive into the Canvas codebase provided the foundation for building a reliable integration with WordPress.
